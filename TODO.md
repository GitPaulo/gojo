## TODO

- ~~Pointers to token type in lexer instead of copies for performance reasons~~
- ~~Reassignments of variables~~
- ~~Fixing infix operators generally lol~~
- Proper function declarations and calls (no arrow functions)
- String concatenation and interpolation (`Hello ${name}`)
- What happens if you try to use operators on the wrong types?
- Making `const` actually constant. Currently it's just a keyword that doesn't do anything.
- `else if` statements
- `for` loops
  - for loops
  - for...in loops
  - for...of loops
- Basic array support?
  - Accessing array elements (arr[index])
  - Array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift)
- Basic json support?
  - Accessing object properties (obj.prop and obj["prop"])
  - Adding properties to objects
- Instead storing line number and text in token structs just store positions in input and look them as needed?
- Some sort of block scope. Perhaps change `env` to a stack of environments (scopes)?
  - Block scope (for let and const)
  - Function scope
  - Global scope
- `...` spread and rest operators
    - Spread operator for arrays and objects (...)
    - Rest parameters in function definitions
